rpc-cms
===========

A CMS warmup project for the r/ProgCollab Web team (RPCWeb)
For now, we have decided it will consist of
 * a blog application for our entire subreddit(http://www.reddit.com/r/progcollab/)
 * a hub application for our future HTML5 game projects (think Kongregate, minus the whole Flash thing :))
 * a general showcase application for all RPCWeb and RPCDesktop projects
